FirstPico.c is the file that is compiled and run on the Pico 1. Each solution to the Kitronik experiments will be moved over to separate file called ExpOne.c, ExpTwo.c etc.


## ExpTwo Ideas
- Make a button that resets the cut off value to the current adc_read.
- DONE initialize the microcontroller by measuring say 10 different values and save the lowest value and the range that they are in. The cut off could then be the lowest value minus an additional figure just to allow some additional fluctuation without turning it off.

## ExpThree
- DONE Figure out why the switch button doesn't always work. Are we doing something wrong here? It seems as if one switch press can trigger many interrupts. Maybe the buttons don't work properly?

## ExpFive
- DONE Experiment more with the gpio_level range. It seems like the servo only operates in the range 500 to around 3200, not 1638 to 8192 as the booklet says.
- It seems as if it requires a long sleep before updating the gpio_level otherwise it won't turn.
- The highest values (3000-3200) seems to cause it to shake, not sure why?

## ExpEight
- Occasionally, I can get the adc read to increase when I blow on the fan, but other times the adc read doesn't change at all based on the movement of the motor. I'm not sure what the problem is here. But I proved that it worked sometimes.

## ExpNine
- Like with many other experiments, the booklet claims the range is 0-65535 (16 bit) but the range ends up being 0-4096 only. Not sure why that is the case.

## ExpTen
- Check and see if having the same interrupt for each of the buttons is a bad idea! NOT A PROBLEM
- The fix was to remove "opts pindirs" from the .side_set 1 and possibly also adding a longer sleep instead of just 80 Âµs. Now it's 50 ms
- What if I want to set different colours for the differen LEDs?

## Debugging

CMakeLists.txt has `pico_enable_stdio_usb(FirstPico 1)` set to 1 to allow us to get logs from `printf` in our terminal. To disable this, set it to `0`.

Then in your main you need the following code:

```
  // Needed for getting logs from `printf` via USB 
    stdio_init_all();
```

To get logs, open a terminal and type `ls /dev/tty.usb*` which should give you a device such as `/dev/tty.usbmodem11401`. Note, that the device does not show up when in BOOTSEL mode. You need to flash the program on the microcontroller first, and then you can get logs. Afterwards, run `screen /dev/tty.usbmodem11401 115200` to receive logs in the terminal.
